      Iâ€™m a developer passionate about creating scalable, high-performance
      backend systems and crafting full-stack applications with robust
      engineering. My focus lies in building backend services using Java and the
      Spring ecosystem, while still maintaining a solid understanding of
      frontend technologies to deliver seamless user experiences.

      In the past, I worked as a Junior Full-Stack Developer at LEAPVN, where I
      gained hands-on experience in building and maintaining web applications
      across the stack. Additionally, I have experience as an AI Engineer, where
      I developed applications involving artificial intelligence and built
      several personal side projects, including a news web application.

      In my spare time, I dedicate myself to learning new technologies, hanging
      out with friends, and constantly improving my skills to stay updated in
      this ever-evolving field of software development.
